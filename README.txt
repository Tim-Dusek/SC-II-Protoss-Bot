Using the Python-SC2 library this ai bot can successfully beat medium computer opponents it play against in the Blizzard game StarCraft II.

Having played Starcraft II since its release in 2010, I have a very in depth understanding of the game mechanics. I thought what better way to put that to the test than to create bot which can play the game.
To figure out how to structure my methods and learn the features of the library a little easier I used a tutorial and then expanded on what I learned and what was shown to me to create a more in depth, more efficient bot.

REQUIRED LIBRARIES:
This program requires 3 libraries to run.
OpenCV, numpy, and python-sc2
They can be installed in windows by opening up the Command Prompt and typing the following:
pip3 install --user --upgrade sc2
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
